# 9 days of Pokemon Go - a statistical analysis

## Introduction

Pokemon Go is finally out. Like every 90' kid (and as a huge fan of the series), I have spent a considerable amount time catching our beloved digital creatures. However, besides spending battery life and swiping my screen like a maniac, I also spent
some time (mostly while charging my phone) logging some of the data from the
in-game events. The purpose of this was to take a statistical look at the patterns, and
behaviour of the game as the player progress in the game.

In this analysis I will present, through several images, tables, and statistical models, how the game rewards you as you level up, how the combat power (CP) of the
Pokemon increase, and an interesting relationship found the CP and the hit points
(HP) of the Pokemon.
